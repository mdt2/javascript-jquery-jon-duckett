###1: The ABC of Programming###:

**A: What is a script and how do I create one?**
+ Start with the big picture by
  1. Define the goal
  2. Design the script
  3. Code each step
+ Use a flowchart

**B: How do computers fit in with the world around them?**
+ Objects are things
  + They have their own properties, events, methods
+ Properties are characteristics that have a name and value
  + Ex: "hotel": "Hilton"
+ Events trigger a section of code
+ Methods are the things people need to do with objects
  + Ex: change the value (method) of the property name "rooms" when someone books (event) a room

**C: How do I write a script for a webpage?**
+ The location of <script> in the HTML affects where the JS is written into the page
  + Can affect loading time of pages
  + Better place to put <script> would be right before the closing body tag
+ Member operator is the dot between an object and a method.
  
###2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

**Statements**
+ End with a semi-colon
  + Variables, calling a functions
  
**Shorthands for variables**
+ Examples:
  + `var price = 4;
  var quantity = 14;`
  
  + `var price, quantity;
  price = 4;
  quantity = 14;`
  
  + `var price = 4, quantity = 14`
+ Variables should be named with camelCase (or, less common, underscores)

**Creating arrays**
+ Use array literals instead of constructor arrays
  + `colors = ['black', 'white'];` not `colors = new Array('white','black);`
